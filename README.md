# Pong

The classic game Pong, where two opponents - the player and the computer - use paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

I've only tried making this game because my friend Benjamin nagged me about it until I made it. :)

In this game, you play against the computer as you hit a ball back and forth with your paddles. Whenever one of you fails to return the ball, the other scores a point. Wins whoever scores 11 points first.

This game was made in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), a "2D and 3D, cross-platform, free and open-source game engine released under the MIT license" that uses GDScript as its scripting language.

## Contributing

The game is still in alpha, given that there are still some bugs to fix and there is no pause menu. Other than that, I won't be taking any suggestions to improve it further. But feel free to report any bugs you find or to fix them.

## Credits

The font used in the game is [Advanced Pixel-7](https://www.dafont.com/advanced-pixel-7.font) by [Style-7](https://www.dafont.com/chess-7-chess-7.d1833). The sprites were made by me in [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite). The ball hit sound was recorded by me.
